- To check after the Step 7, We can pump any no. of times and the string will be accepted by FA. Hence is called pumping lemma.

## Q1. L = { ${a^{n}}^{2}$ | n $\geq$ 0 }. Proove L is not regular by Pumping lemma.
- S1: Assume L is regular.
- S2: There exists FA of 'n' states aceepting L.
- S3: Take a string 'w' | |w| $\geq$ n.. Take |w| = $n^{2}$ i.e. w = $a^{n^{2}}$
  - For n = 4, w = $a^{16}$
  - For n = 5, w = $a^{25}$
- S4: Since |w| $\geq$ n, Hence in acceptance path $\exists$ a loop.
- S5: Divide w into 3 parts x,y,z
- S6: Since w $\in$ L, So all w' also $\in$ L. where w' = xy $^{i}$ z | $\forall$ i $\geq$ 0
- S7: Find w' $\notin$ L.

### Solution
- for i =2
- w' = xy $^{2}$ z
- w' = xyyz
- |w'| = |xyyz| = |xyz| + |y|
- |w'| = $n^{2}$ + |y|
- Range of |y| = 1 to n
- $n^{2} + 1$ $\leq$ |w'| $\leq$ $n^{2}$ + n
- $n^{2}$ $\lt$ |w'| $\lt$ $n^{2}$ + n + 1
- $n^{2}$ $\lt$ |w'| $\lt$ $n^{2}$ + n + 1 + n
- $n^{2}$ $\lt$ |w'| $\lt$ $(n+1)^{2}$
- Here we found that some string w' will have length between $n^{2}$ and $(n+1)^{2}$ but
- L = { $\epsilon, a, a^{4}, a^{9}, a^{16}, ...$ }
- Not string in L is having length between $n^{2}$ and $(n+1)^{2}$
- Hence w' $\notin$ L
- Hence L is not regular.

## Q2. L = { $a^{p}$ | p is prime }. Proove L is not regular by Pumping lemma.
- S1: Assume L is regular.
- S2: There exists FA of 'n' states aceepting L.
- S3: Take a string 'w' | |w| $\geq$ n.. Take w = $a^{p}$ | p $\geq$ n
- S4: Since |w| $\geq$ n, Hence in acceptance path $\exists$ a loop.
- S5: Divide w into 3 parts x,y,z
- S6: Since w $\in$ L, So all w' also $\in$ L. where w' = xy $^{i}$ z | $\forall$ i $\geq$ 0
- S7: Find w' $\notin$ L.
- Take i = p+1
- w' = xy $^{p+1}$ z
- |w'| = |xyz| + | $y^{p}$ |
- |w'| = p + p*y
- |w'| = p(1+y)
- y ranges from 1 to p
- |w'| = 2p, 3p, 4p, ... , (p+1)p
- None of the above is prime.
- Hence w' $\notin$ L
- Hence L is not regular.
