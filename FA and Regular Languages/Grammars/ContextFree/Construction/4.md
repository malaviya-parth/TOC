## Comparison between a's and b's, are not ordered

### Create Grammar for the Language L = { w | $n_{a}(w) = n_{b}(w) $}

- S -> aSb | bSa | $\epsilon$
- This is not the correct answer as it will generate strigns with equal a's and b's but not all strings with equal a's and b's like abba, baab, etc.
- Just some orders of a's and b's are not getting generated we will combine both
- $\therefore$ S -> aSb | bSa | $\epsilon$ | SS
- From this we can generate all strings with equal a's and b's
- For String abaabaabbabb 
```
      S
     /|\ 
    a S b
      /\
     S       S
    /|\   /     \
   b S a  S      S
     |   /|\   /   \
     ϵ  a S b  S     S
          |   /|\   /|\
          ϵ  a S b  a S b
               /|\     |
              a S b    ϵ
                |
                ϵ
```
**Other Grammars for the same language**
- S -> aSb | bSa | $\epsilon$ | SS | SSS
- S -> aSbS | bSaS | $\epsilon$
- S -> SaSb | SbSa | $\epsilon$
- S -> SaSbS | SbSaS | $\epsilon$ (redundant S)
- S -> aA | bB | $\epsilon$
    - A -> b | bS | aAA
    - B -> a | aS | bBB

### Do these two grammars have different Power?
**S -> aSb | bSa | $\epsilon$ | SS and S -> aSb | bSa | $\epsilon$ | SS | SSS**

- No, both have same power
- SS generates all strings with equal a's and b's so having SSS is redundant
From SS we can generate SSS
```
     S
    / \
   S   S
   |  / \
   ϵ  S   S
```
- This is how we generate SSS from SS
- So both have same power

### L = { w | $n_{a}(w) = 2n_{b}(w) $}, Create Grammar for this language

- The edge cases for this will be $\epsilon$, aab, aba, baa
- Now just loop over them through S and combine them
- S -> $\epsilon$ | aSaSb | aSbSa | bSaSa | SS
- S -> $\epsilon$ | aSaSbS | aSbSaS | bSaSaS
- S -> $\epsilon$ | SaSaSb | SaSbSa | SbSaSa
- S -> $\epsilon$ | SaSaSbS | SaSbSaS | SbSaSaS (redundant S)

### Dybe Set of a String:- Set of all well formed strings of parenthesis

- (), ()(), (()())() ✅
- )(, ())( ❌
 
- S -> (S) | SS | $\epsilon$

- Mapping of Dybe Set of a String to a and b string
- L = {$ w | If v is prefix of w then n_{a}(v) \geq n_{b}(v)$}
