**L = {$ w.x.w^{T} | w \in \{a,b\}^{*}, x \in \{a,b\}^{*} $}**
**All Possible strings ove a & b**
- Here w $\in$ $\{a,b\}^{*}$ and x $\in$ $\{a,b\}^{*}$.
- Supoose w we take null and consider only x, x over $\{a,b\}^{*}$ generates all strings over  a & b. So, we can make any strinf using x keeping the w as null string.
- So, using x we can make finite Automata and hence it is a regular language.
- Regular ✅


**L = {$ w.x.w^{T} | w \in \{a,b\}^{*}, x \in \{a,b\}^{+} $}**
**All Possible strings ove a & b except null**
- Regular ✅
- Everything just null is not there is x.

**L = {$ w.x.w^{T} | w \in \{a,b\}^{+}, x \in \{a,b\}^{*} $}**
**All Possible strings ove a & b with start and end with same letter and length atleast 2**
- Regular ✅
- Just leave the edge this time as w belongs to $\{a,b\}^{+}$ but yes take smallest string possible which will be a or b, rest things give them to x.

**L = {$ w.x.w^{T} | w \in \{a,b\}^{+}, x \in \{a,b\}^{+} $}**
**All Possible strings ove a & b with start and end with same letter and length atleast 3**
- Regular ✅

**L = {$ w.x.w^{T} | w \in \{a,b\}^{*}, x \in \{a,b\} $}**
**All odd palindromes over a & b**
- Regular ❌

**L = {$ w.x.w^{T} | w \in \{a,b\}, x \in \{a,b\} $}**
- Regular ✅

**L = {$ w.x.w^{T} | w \in \{a,b\}^{*}, x \in \{a,b\}^{*}, |x| \le 5 $}**
- Regular ❌
- As x can eat limited amount of string so higger amount of string remains with w and string comparison occurs.
