**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b whose length is atleast 2**
- $(a + b)^{2}.(a + b)^{*}$
- $(a + b).(a + b)^{+}$

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b whose length is atmost 2**
- $\epsilon + (a + b) + (a + b)^{2}$
- It can also be be written as $(\epsilon + a +b)^{2}$

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b whose length is atmost 100**
- $(\epsilon + a + b)^{100}$

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b which contain exactly one a**
- $b^{*}.a.b^{*}$

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b which contain exactly two a**
- $b^{*}.a.b^{*}.a.b^{*}$ or $(b^{*}.a.b^{*})^{2}$

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b which contain atmost one a**
- $b^{*}.a.b^{*} + b^{*}$
- $b^{*}.(a + \epsilon).b^{*}$

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b which contain atmost two a**
- $b^{*}.a.b^{*}.a.b^{*} + b^{*}.a.b^{*} + b^{*}$
- $b^{*}.(\epsilon + a).b^{*}.(\epsilon + a).b^{*}$
- $b^{*}.(\epsilon + a + a.b^{*}.a).b^{*}$ ❓❓

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b which contain atleast one a**
- $(a + b)^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}$
- $b^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}$
- $(a + b)^{*}.a.b^{*}$
- A string baabbbabab has 4 a's and so it can be made using 4 different ways from the first formula (n a's then n ways).
- Using second formula, it can be made using only single way.
- Using third formula, it can be made using 1 way only.
- Although all are equivalent to each other.

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b which contain atleast two a**
- $(a + b)^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}$
- $b^{*}.a.b^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}$ 
- $(a + b)^{*}.a.b^{*}.a.b^{*}$
- $b^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}.a.b^{*}$
- Using formula 1, String can be made using ${ n \choose 2}$.
- Using formula 2, String can be made using only 1 way.
- Using formula 3, String can be made using 1 way only.

**Construct a R.E. for all strings over a & b which contain atleast one a and atleast one b**
- $(a + b)^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}.b.(a + b)^{*}$ + $(a + b)^{*}.b.(a + b)^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}$ (Redundant)
- $(a + b)^{*}.a.(a + b)^{*}.b.(a + b)^{*} + b^{+}.a^{+}$ (Efficient)
  - The first term gives atleast one a and atleast one b but only those strings which have a before b. So, we need to add the second term which gives atleast one a and atleast one b but only those strings which have b before a.
- $(a + b)^{*}.ab.(a + b)^{*} + (a + b)^{*}.ba.(a + b)^{*}$
