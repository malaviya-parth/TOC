## Extra
**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m + n =15$ }**
- This is Regular as concatenation of 2 Regular languages (1)L = { $a^{n}b^{m} | m + n =15$ } and (2)L = { $c^{p} | p >= 0$ } is Regular.

## 2nd test continued

**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m + n =p$ }**
- Comparison is there as well as language is infinite so it is CFL.
- All other operators i.e. >=, <=, >, <, != are all CFL.

**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m - n =p$ }**
- Same case as of above.

**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m * n = p$ }**
- Multiplication and Division are not in scope of FA and PDA so it is not CFL. It is CSL.

**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m / n = p$ }**
- Same case as of above.

**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p}d^{q} | m + n = p + q$ }**
- m + n = p + q OR
- m + p = n + q OR
- m + q = n + p
- All Languages will be CFL

**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p}d^{q} | m - n = p - q$ }**
- m - n = p - q OR
- m - p = n - q OR
- m - q = n - p
- All Languages will be CFL

**L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p}d^{q} | m * n = p * q$ }**
- m * n = p * q OR
- m * p = n * q OR
- m * q = n * p
- All Languages will be CSL

| Operation | Example | RHS | Type |

|    -,/    | m - n =c| Constant | CFL |

3. Infinite Comparisons
- 1 Comparisons
    - Infinite Linear Comparisons are CFL.
    - Infinite Non-Linear Comparisons are CSL.
- \> 1 Comparisons
    - Infinite Linear Comparisons (CSL):
        - If there is compariosn but with AND operator then it is CSL.
        - Ex: $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m = n \& n = p$ is CsL.
        - Ex: $a^{m}b^{m}c^{n}d^{n} | m,n >= 0$ is CSL.
        - Ex: $a^{n}b^{m}c^{m} | n > m$ is CSL.
           - Because it is same as $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m =p \& n > m$.
        - If there is comparison but with OR operator then it is CFL.
        - Ex: $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p} | m = n OR n = p$ is CFL.
- Infinite String Comparison
    - Depends on the given String
    - Ex: $w.w^{R}$ is CFL
    - Ex: w.w is CSL
    - Ex: $w.w^{R}.w^{R}$ is CSL
    - Ex: $w^{R}.w.w^{R}$ is CSL
    - Ex: $w^{R}.w^{R}.w$ is CSL
    - Ex: $w_{1}.w_{1}^{R}.w_{2}.w_{2}^{R}$ is CFL

| Type | Order | Language |
| ---- | ----- | -------- |
| 1 String Matching | Reverse | CFL |
| 1 String Matching | Straight| CSL |
| > 1 String Matching | Reverse | CSL |
| > 1 String Matching | Straight | CSL |

**L = { $w_{1}.w_{2}.w_{3}.w_{4} | w_{1} = w_{2}^{R} \& w_{3} = w_{4}^{R}$ }**
- Here by looking it looks like there are more than one comparison, but both comparisons are on different string so it is CFL.
- It resembles $w_{1}.w_{1}^{R}.w_{2}.w_{2}^{R}$ which is CFL.

**L = { $w_{1}.w_{2}.w_{3}.w_{4} | w_{1} = w_{2}^{R} \& w_{1} = w_{4}^{R}$ }**
- This is different from above and it is CSL as here we can say more than one comparison because both sides w1 is there so it is compared on both the sides.

**L = { $w_{1}.w_{2}.w_{3}.w_{4} | w_{1} = w_{2}^{R} || w_{1} = w_{4}^{R}$ }**
- Here it is CFL as there is OR operator, so need to match one string both side and take union of both the strings.

**L = { $w_{1}.w_{2}.w_{3}.w_{4} | w_{1} = w_{2}^{R} || w_{1} = w_{3}^{R} || w_{1} = w_{4}^{R}$ }**
- Even this is CFL

> Again if the straight order comes then again it is CSL.

**L = { $w_{1}.w_{2}.w_{3}.w_{4} | w_{1} = w_{2} \& w_{3} = w_{4}$ }**
- CSL as it is straight order.
