## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains "aa" as a substring.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> aS | bS | aA
    - A -> aB
    - B -> aB | bB | $\epsilon$

- aS and bS any random string
- aA is the string which contains first "a" of "aa"
- aB is the string which contains second "a" of "aa"
- B then will generate whatever we want to generate after "aa"

### First
- Example: abababbb aa bbababbba
- S -> aS | bS will generate abababbb
- S -> aA will generate a
- A -> aB will generate a
- B -> aB | bB | $\epsilon$ will generate aa bbababbba

### Second
- Example: ababbaaab aa baababb
- S -> aS | bS will generate ababbaaab
- S -> aA will generate a
- A -> aB will generate a
- B -> aB | bB | $\epsilon$ will generate baababb
- Here genarates at least one aa, so no problem if we generate more than one aa using aS | aB.

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains "a" as substring.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> bS | aA
    - A -> aA | bA | $\epsilon$
- aA verifies the occurence of "a" in the string

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains "b" as substring.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> aS | bA
    - A -> aA | bA | $\epsilon$
- bA verifies the occurence of "b" in the string

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains number of a's divisible by 3.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> aA | bS | $\epsilon$
    - A -> aB | bA
    - B -> aS | bB 
- **Explanation:**
- aA, aB, aS generates 3a
- In between whatever amount of b comes, it will loop on the same rule
- Generation of a's multiple of 3 will take us back to S where we kept $\epsilon$ to terminate the string

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains number of a's when divided by 3, remainder is 1.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> aA | bS
    - A -> aB | bA | $\epsilon$
    - B -> aS | bB

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains number of a's not divisible by 3.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> aA | bS
    - A -> aB | bA | $\epsilon$
    - B -> aS | bB | $\epsilon$

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains number of a's divisible by 5.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> aA | bS | $\epsilon$
    - A -> aB | bA
    - B -> aC | bB
    - C -> aD | bC
    - D -> aS | bD

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains atLeast 1 a.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> bS | aA
    - A -> aA | bA | $\epsilon$

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains atLeast 2 a.

- **Solution:**
    - **Grammar:** S -> bS | aA
    - A -> bA | aB
    - B -> bB | aB | $\epsilon$

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains exactly 1 a.

- S -> bS | aA
- A -> bA | $\epsilon$

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains exactly 2 a.

- S -> bS | aA
- A -> bA | aB
- B -> bB | $\epsilon$

- Suppose bA is removed from A then we won't be able to produce string like aba
- Suppose bB is removed from B then we won't be able to produce string like aab

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains atmost 1 a.

- S -> bS | aA | $\epsilon$
- A -> bA | $\epsilon$

## Construct a Grammar which generate all those strings over {a,b} which contains atmost 2 a.

- S -> bS | aA | $\epsilon$
- A -> bA | aB | $\epsilon$
- B -> bB | $\epsilon$
