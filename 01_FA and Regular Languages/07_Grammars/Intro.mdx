### Grammar is a generating device used to generate Strings

#### It is represented by a 4-tuple (V, T, P, S)
- V: Non-Empty finite Set of variables or non-terminals symbols
- T: Set of terminals symbols
- P: Set of production rules
- S: Start symbol

- Non-Terminal symbols are used to generate non-terminal or terminal symbols
- Terminal symobls are basic/ fundamental symbols that cannot further generate non-terminal or terminal symbols. They are atomic
- Non-Terminal symobls are represented by upper case letters
- Terminal symobls are represented by lower case letters
- $\epsilon$ is not a terminal symbol but it is a special symbol called null string used to represent absence of terminal symbols

### Example
- \<Sentence\>  --> \<Noun Phrase\> \<Verb Phrase\>
- \<Noun Phrase\> --> Ram
- \<Noun Phrase\> --> Shyam
- \<Verb Phrase\> --> Eaitng
- \<Verb Phrase\> --> Sleeping

Here:
- N -> { \<Sentence\>, \<Noun Phrase\>, \<Verb Phrase\> }
- T -> { Ram, Shyam, Eating, Sleeping }
- P -> { \<Sentence\>  --> \<Noun Phrase\> \<Verb Phrase\>, \<Noun Phrase\> --> Ram, \<Noun Phrase\> --> Shyam, \<Verb Phrase\> --> Eaitng, \<Verb Phrase\> --> Sleeping }
- S -> \<Sentence\>

#### Sentence / String generated by a grammar
- Sentence is a string of terminal symbols
1. Start with start symbol
2. After applying any number of production rules, in any order
3. Concatenation of any number of terminal symbols is called a sentence generated by a grammar

#### Example
- Ram Sleeping
- Shyam Eating

#### Sentential Form
- Sentential form is a string of terminal and non-terminal symbols
1. Start with start symbol
2. After applying any number of production rules, in any order
3. Concatenation of any number of terminal and non-terminal symbols is called a sentential form

#### Example
- Ram \<Verb Phrase\>
- \<Noun \> Sleeping
- \<Noun Phrase\> \<Verb Phrase\>
- Ram Sleeping

```
Every String/Sentence is a sentential form but every sentential form is not a string/sentence
```

#### Language generated by a grammar L(G)
- L(G) is a set of all strings generated by a grammar G
- L(G) = { Ram Sleeping, Shyam Eating, Ram Eating, Shyam Sleeping }


### Example
```
S -> aS/bS/a
G = ( {S}, {a, b}, {S -> aS/bS/a}, S )
L(G) = { a, aa, aba, ba, baa, bab, aaa, ... }
It can be noticed that this grammar generates strings that end's with a
```
```
S -> aS/bS/b
G = ( {S}, {a, b}, {S -> aS/bS/b}, S )
L(G) = { b, ab, bb, aab, abb, bbb, aaab, ... }
It can be noticed that this grammar generates strings that end's with b
```

### Question
S -> aS/bS/$\epsilon$

G = ( {S}, {a, b}, {S -> aS/bS/$\epsilon$}, S )

L(G) = { $\epsilon$, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, ... }

All possible strings over {a, b} are generated by this grammar

### Question
S -> aS/bA/$\epsilon$

A -> bA/$\epsilon$

G = ( {S, A}, {a, b}, {S -> aS/bA/$\epsilon$, A -> bA/$\epsilon$}, S )

L(G) = { $\epsilon$, a, b, aa, ab, bb, abb, aaaab, ... }

L(G) = { $ a^{n}b^{m} $ | n,m >= 0 }

### Question
S -> aSb/$\epsilon$

L(G) = { $\epsilon$, ab, aabb, aaabbb, ... }

Those strings over a abd b which have equal number of a's followed by equal number of b's
