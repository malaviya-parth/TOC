## Finite Language
- A language is finite if it contains finite number of strings.

**Generating Rules from Finite Language:**
### First Example:
- L = {a, ab, bba}
- **Solution:**
    - S -> a | ab | bba
    - S -> a | aA | bB
    - A -> b
    - B -> bC
    - C -> a
### Second Example:
- L = {1100, 1010}
- **Solution:**
    - S -> 1100 | 1010
    - S -> 1A
    - A -> 1B | 0C
    - B -> 0D
    - C -> 1D
    - D -> 0

# Every Finite Language is Regular

## Construct a Language which have any number of a's followed by any number of b's

- **Solution:**
    - S -> aS | aA
    - A -> bA | e
- This language will not be able to produce $\epsilon$

- **Solution:**
    - S -> aS | aA | ϵ
    - A -> bA | ϵ
- This language will be able to produce b

- **Solution:**
    - S -> aS | aA | ϵ | b
    - A -> bA | ϵ
- This language will be able to produce bb, bbb, ...

---
- **Solution:**
    - S -> aS | aA | ϵ | bA
    - A -> bA | ϵ

## Construct a Language for L = { $a^{n}cb^{m}$ | n,m >= 0 }

- **Solution:**
    - S -> c | aS | bA
    - A -> bA | $\epsilon$
- This language will not be able to produce cb, cbb, ...

- **Solution:**
    - S -> cA | aS | bA
    - A -> bA | $\epsilon$
- This language will be able to produce ab which is not in the language

- **Solution:**
    - S -> cA | aS
    - A -> bA | $\epsilon$

## Construct a Language for L = { $a^{n}b^{m}$ | n,m >= 1 }

- **Solution:**
    - S -> aA
    - A -> aA | bB
    - B -> bB | $\epsilon$

## Construct a Language for L = { $a^{n}cb^{m}$ | n,m >= 1 }

- **Solution:**
    - S -> aA
    - A -> bA | cB
    - B -> bB | b

## Construct a Language for L = { $a^{n}b^{m}c^{p}d^{q}e^{r}$ | n,m,p,q,r >= 0 }

- **Solution:**
    - S -> $\epsilon$ | aS | bA | cB | dC | eD
    - A -> bA | cB | dC | eD | $\epsilon$
    - B -> cB | dC | eD | $\epsilon$
    - C -> dC | eD | $\epsilon$
    - D -> eD | $\epsilon$
