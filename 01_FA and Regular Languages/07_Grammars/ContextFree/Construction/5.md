## Palindromes

- Smallest even palindrome: $\epsilon$
- Smallest odd palindrome: $a$

### L = {$ w.w^{T} | w \in (a,b)^{*}$} (Even Palindromes)
### L = {$ w.x.w^{T}  | w \in (a,b)^{*}, x \in (a,b)$} (Odd Palindromes)

### L = {$ w.x.w^{T}  | w \in (a,b)^{*}, x \in (a,b, \epsilon)$} (All Palindromes)
### L = {$ w | w \in (a,b)^{*} AND w = w^{T} $} (All Palindromes)
- We can also write in place of T where R means Reversal

### Hash Palindromes
L = {$ w\#w^{T} | w \in (a,b)^{*} \& \# \notin (a,b) \& |\#|=1 $} (All Palindromes)

## How many n length palindromes are there over a & b?
- We need to worry about only n/2 characters as the other half is the reverse of the first half
- Even: $2^{n/2}$

- Odd: $2^{(n+1)/2}$
- It will be divided into 3 parts
    - First half | Middle | Second Half
    -  (n-1)/2       | 1      | (n-1)/2
- Selection ways for First Half: $2^{(n-1)/2}$
- Selection ways for Middle: $2^{1}$
- Selection ways for Second Half: 1
- Total: $2^{(n-1)/2} * 2^{1} * 1 = 2^{(n+1)/2}$

## How many n length palindromes are there over a, b & c?
- Even: $3^{n/2}$
- Odd: $3^{(n+1)/2}$

## Grammar for Palindromes
- S -> aSa | bSb | $\epsilon$ (Even Palindromes)
- S -> aSa | bSb | a | b (Odd Palindromes)
- S -> aSa | bSb | a | b | $\epsilon$ (All Palindromes)

### Over {a,b,c}
- S -> aSa | bSb | cSc | a | b | c | $\epsilon$

### Language genrated by Grammar S -> aSa | bSb | aSb | bSa | $\epsilon$
1. Regular
2. Context Free
3. Context Sensitive
4. Recursively Enumerable

- As the Grammar written is CFG, so it is CFL, CSL and RE
- Now we just need to check for Regular
- Given grammar producess all strings of even length
- So, it is Regular as it is possible to create automata of this.
- Answer: 1,2,3,4

## Grammar for all palindromes over in English

- S -> aSa | bSb | ... | zSz | a | b | ... | z | $\epsilon$

L = {$ w.a^{n}b^{n}.w^{T} | w \in (a,b)^{*} \& n \ge 0$}

- This language is also CFL composed of 2 CFLs
    - $L_{1} = \{a^{n}b^{n} | n \ge 0\}$
    - $L_{2} = \{w.w^{T} | w \in (a,b)^{*}\}$

- Grammar: S -> aSa | bSb | A
           A -> aAb | $\epsilon$
