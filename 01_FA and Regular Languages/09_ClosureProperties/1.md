## Closure Properties of Regular Languages

### **Reversal or Transpose**
- If $L$ is regular then $L^{R}$ is regular.
- Regular is closed under reversal operation.
- For $L^{R}$, In FA we swap initial and final states, reverse all the edges and if more than one final state then make a dummy initial state and connect it to all the final states with null move.
- Notation:
    - L = { $w | w \in L$ }
    - $L^{R}$ = { $w^{R} | w \in L$ }

### **Concatenation**
- If $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are regular then $L_{1}L_{2}$ is regular.
- Notation:
    - $L_{1}L_{2}$ = { $xy | x \in L_{1} and y \in L_{2}$ }
    - $L1_{n} = 2$ and $L2_{n} = 3$ then $L_{1}L_{2} = 5$
    - |x| = 2 and |y| = 3 then |xy| = 5
- Ex: L1 = { $a^{n} | n \geq 0$ } and L2 = { $b^{n} | n \geq 0$ } then $L_{1}L_{2}$ = { $a^{n}b^{m} | n,m \geq 0$ } notice it's not $b^{n}$ as length will be different.

### Union
- If L1 and L2 are regular then $L_{1} \cup L_{2}$ is regular.
    - $L_{1} = { w_{1} | w_{1} \in L_{1} }$
    - $L_{2} = { w_{2} | w_{2} \in L_{2} }$
    - $L_{1} \cup L_{2}$ = { $w_{1} | w_{1} \in L_{1}$ or $w_{1} \in L_{2}$ }

### Complement
- If L is regular then $L^{C}$ is regular.
- $L^{C}$ = { $w | w \in \Sigma^{*}$ and $w \notin L$ }
- $L(\overline{M})$ = $\overline{L(M)}$ only for the case of DFA but not for NFA.

### Intersection
- If L1 and L2 are regular then $L_{1} \cap L_{2}$ is regular.  
- $L_{1} \cap L_{2}$ = { $w | w \in L_{1}$ and $w \in L_{2}$ }

### Difference
- If L1 and L2 are regular then $L_{1} - L_{2}$ is regular.
- $L_{1} - L_{2}$ = { $w | w \in L_{1}$ and $w \notin L_{2}$ }
