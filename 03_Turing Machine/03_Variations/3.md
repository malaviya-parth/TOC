## Restrictions on Turing Machine to Reduce it's power

1. Tape as a Stack
   - First only Read head from where it can read the symbols 
   - Second Read
   - Write ead but here it can't left and right on choice but moves accroding to the stack operation.
   - This works like a PDA where from one place we read and other place we perform stack operation.
   - Less powerful

2. TM with only Read Head
   - Works like a Finite Automata
   - Less powerful

3. One way Head 
   - Only one way movement
   - Works like a Finite Automata
   - Less powerful

4. Halting Turing Machine
   - For REC
   - Less powerful
  
5. Amount of Tape used is linear function of input size
   - LBA
   - Less powerful
