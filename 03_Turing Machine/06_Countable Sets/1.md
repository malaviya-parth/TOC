## Theorem
- Every finite set is countable (It is a one way theorem)
- Every countble set is Discrete (It is a two way theorem)
- Natural Numbers $\mathbb{N}$ $\rightarrow$ Countably Infinite $\rightarrow$ Discrete
- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$ $\rightarrow$ Countably Infinite $\rightarrow$ Discrete
- Real Numbers $\mathbb{R}$ $\rightarrow$ Uncountably Infinite $\rightarrow$ Continuous

## Definition
- Set is countable iff $\exists$ a bijection between the given set and any subset of $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$.  
- Set is countable iff $\exists$ enumeration method using which all the elements of the set can be generated & for any particular element of the set, it takes only finite no. of steps to generate it & these steps can be taken as its index.
