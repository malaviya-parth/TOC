- In case of Rational Numbers, we do union of Countably Infinite Sets, where one set represents the set of all rational numbers with denominator 1, another set represents the set of all rational numbers with denominator 2, and so on. And the union of all these sets is the set of all rational numbers. And the set of all rational numbers is countably infinite.

- Finite union of Countably Infinite Sets is Countably Finite.
- Countably Ininite union of Countably Finite Sets is Countably Ininite.
- Countably Finite union of Uncountably Infinite Set with Countably Finite Set is Countably Infinite.
- Uncountably Infinite union of Countably Finite Sets is Uncountably Infinite.

Canter proved that the set of real numbers is uncountable. He used the diagonalization method to prove this.  
He also proved that $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ is uncountably infinite.

## Modified Complex No. set where co-ordinates are integers and not real numbers
- The set of complex numbers here will be countably infinite.
- The entitiy a + ib, here a and b both will be integers.
- And to get Complex numbers we just need to have cross product of both the sets of integers.
- CI x CI = CI $\cup$ CI = CI

## Every subset of Countably Infinite Set is Countably Infinite
- No, Apart from Countably Infinite subset can be finite as well.
