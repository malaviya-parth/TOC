## Homomorphism:-
- Replace each Input alphabet symbol with a string designed from another set of symbol ($\Gamma$) function or mapping.
  - $\Sigma = \{a,b\}, \Gamma = \{0,1\}$
  - If, $h(a) = 0, h(b) = 1$
    - If, $L = a^*b^*$
      - $h(L) = 0^*1^*$
    - If, $L = \{a^nb^n | n \geq 0\}$
      - $h(L) = \{0^n1^n | n \geq 0\}$
  - If, $h(a) = 010, h(b) = 101$
    - If, $L = a^*b^*$
      - $h(L) = (010)^*(101)^*$
    - If, $L = \{a^nb^n | n \geq 0\}$
      - $h(L) = \{(010)^n(101)^n | n \geq 0\}$
- Here we have just mapped the $\Sigma$ characters with $\Gamma^*$ strings.

### Regular are closed under Homomorphism
### DCFL are not closed under Homomorphism

- If $\Sigma = \{a,b,\#\}$ and $\Gamma = \{0,1\}
  - If we replace a $\rightarrow$ 0, b $\rightarrow$ 1, # $\rightarrow$ 0
  - For L = $w\#w^T$ $h(L)$ will no tbe DCFL, as we won't know which 0 is mapped to #.

### CFL are closed under Homomorphism

- Here while PDA construction what we do is reading 0 we push a in stack, and reading 1 we pop a from stack this is how we replace 0 & 1 with a & b.
- This is why CFL are closed

### CSL are not closed under Homomorphism

- Condition here is RHS of production should be longer than LHS
  - If we have a production $bA \rightarrow aaaaaB$ and we replace a with $\epsilon$  & b with 0 then RHS is not longer than LHS ($0A \rightarrow B$). Hence CSL are not closed under Homomorphism.
### REC are not closed under Homomorphism

- Using the $\epsilon$ we might get stuck into infinite loop which is not allowed in REC. 
### RE are closed under Homomorphism

## $\lambda$-free Homomorphism

Similar to Homomorphism but we don't map any character to $\epsilon$.
### Regular is closed
### DCFL is not closed
### CFL is closed
### CSL is closed
### REC is closed
### RE is closed

## Substitution (Generalization of Homomorphism)
Replace each Input alphabet symbol with a language designed from another set of symbol but type of language should be same as input language.
- $\Gamma^*$ was the language in Homomorphism
- Here we can have any language 
- $\Sigma \rightarrow 2^{\Gamma^*}$
- $2^{\Gamma^*}$ is the set of all languages over $\Gamma^*$
  - Let $\Sigma = \{a,b\}, \Gamma = \{0,1\}$
  - $a \rightarrow 0^*$ and $b \rightarrow 1^*$
    - If L = $a^*b^*$ then $h(L) = (0^*)^*(1^*)^*$ = $0^*1^*$

## $\lambda$-free Substitution (Generalization of $\lambda$-free Homomorphism)
#### Regular are closed under $\lambda$-free Substitution
#### DCFL are not closed under $\lambda$-free Substitution
#### CFL are closed under $\lambda$-free Substitution
#### CSL are closed under $\lambda$-free Substitution
#### REC are closed under $\lambda$-free Substitution
#### RE are closed under $\lambda$-free Substitution

## Inverse Homomorphism
#### All languages are closed

### Example
- $\Sigma = \{a,b\}, \Gamma = \{0,1,2\}$
- h(a) = 0, h(b) = 12
- L = $0^*(12)^*$, then $h^{-1}(L) = ?$
  - $h^{-1}(L) = a^*b^*$

## Q. $\Sigma = \{0,1,2\}, \Gamma = \{a,b\}$ h(0) = a, h(1) = ab, h(2) = ba
- L = {ababa}, $h^{-1}(L) = ?$
  - $h^{-1}(L) = {022,110,102}

## Q. $L = a(ba)^*, h^{-1}(L) = ?$, h(0) = a, h(1) = ab, h(2) = ba
- L = {a, aba, ababa, abababa, ...}
- $h^{-1}(L) = \{0, 02, 10, 022, 110, 102, ...\}$
- $1^*02^*$

## Q. $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ and $\Gamma = \{a,b\}$, h(0) = aa, , h(1) = aba, L = (ab+ba)*a
- L = {a, aba, baa, abbaa, baaba, ...}
- $h^{-1}(L) = \{1\}$
- Only aba can be mapped no other mapping is possible.
- $h(h^{-1}(L)) = h(\{1\}) = \{aba\}$

> Note:
>> In case of Invere Homomorphism we can't always get the original language back, by doing f(f'(L)) = L.

## Q. $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$ and $\Gamma = \{a,b\}$, h(0) = a, h(1) = a, L = 0*1*, h(L) = ?, $h^{-1}(h(L)) = ?$
- h(L) = $a^*a^*$ = $a^*$
- $h^{-1}(h(L)) = h^{-1}(a^*) = (0+1)^*$

> Note:
>> In case of Invere Homomorphism we can't always get the original language back, by doing f'(f(L)) = L.

## Q. If L is $\infty$ then h(L) is also $\infty$.
- ‚ùå False
- We can easily replace characters of $\Sigma$ with $\Gamma^*$ then, why still can we get finite string.
- Because we can replace the character with $\epsilon$ as well.
