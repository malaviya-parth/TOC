### PDA is acceptance device for CFLs
- A Language is CFL iff $\exists$ a PDA that accepts it. ✅
- A Language is CFL if $\exists$ FA that accepts it. ✅
- A Language is CFL iff $\exists$ FA that accepts it. ❌

## Q. Why {$a^{n}b^{n}|n\geq 1$} is not accepted by FA?
- There are infinite stringds in this Language
- Also we need to keep track of number of a's to match with number of b's
- FA has finite memory, so it can't keep track of infinite strings
- So FA can't accept this Language

### PDA = FA + Stack of Infinite Memory
### FA + Stack(Null Store) of Finite Memory = FA (This will just increase number of states in FA)
- If FA with Stack of finite memory is used we can make FA with less number of states
- Stack is also called Null Store  

**Formal Definition of PDA:-**
- PDA is a 7-tuple $(Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_{0},Z_{0},F)$
- $Z_{0}$ is the initial Pushdown Symbol
- $\Gamma$ is set of Stack Symbols

## PDA
- We have a tape of finite length and a stack of infinite length
- Tape contains input string
- Stack initially contains $Z_{0}$
- Invalid Input to PDA means string is not made from $\Sigma$
- $\Gamma$ says what all symbols can be pushed into stack just like $\Sigma$ says what all symbols can be written on tape
- $Z_{0} \in \Gamma$ and $Z_{0} \notin \Sigma$

## Transition Function of PDA
- After reading a symbol from input tape and top of stack, transition function $\delta$ tells where to go next as well as what to push into stack.
- Ex: $\delta(q_{1},a,Z_{0}) = (q_{2},aZ_{0})$ means after reading $a$ from input tape and $Z_{0}$ from stack, we will go to state $q_{2}$ and push $a$ into stack
- $\delta$ : $Q\times\Sigma\times\Gamma \rightarrow Q\times\Gamma^{*}$ (True move)
- $\delta$: $Q\times\epsilon\times\Gamma \rightarrow Q\times\Gamma^{*}$ (Null move)
- $\delta$: $Q\times(\Sigma\cup\{\epsilon\})\times\Gamma \rightarrow Q\times\Gamma^{*}$

## Conclusion
- Read at most one symbol from the tape
- Read exactly one symbol from stack (Also it is the topmost symbol)
- Push any number of symbols into stack
- since in every move we need to read exacly one symbol from the stack that's why we kept $Z_{0}$ in the stack initially.

## Some Basic Concept clearing examples
- $\delta(q_{0},a,b) = (q_{1},ab)$ ✅
- $\delta(q_{0},\epsilon,b) = (q_{1},bb)$ ✅
- $\delta(q_{0},a,Z_{0}) = (q_{1},aZ_{0})$ ✅
- $\delta(q_{0},\epsilon,Z_{0}) = (q_{1},x)$ ✅
- $\delta(q_{0},b,\epsilon) = (q_{1},cdfb)$ ❌ (Need to read exactly one symbol from stack)
- $\delta(q_{0},a,b) = (q_{1},\epsilon)$ ✅
- $\delta(q_{0},Z_{0},a) = (q_{1},a)$ ❌ (Z0 is not in $\Sigma$)
