## Q7. Number of steps required to generate any string of length n from CFG in CNF? (GATE PYQ)
- Suppose we wnat to make any n length string first we need to make n N.T. symbols and then we need to conver them into terminal symbols.
- In first step we can create 2 N.T. symbols and then in each step we can create 1 N.T. symbol.
- Like if 4 steps are taken to generate N.T. then it can generate 5 N.T.
- Then n steps to generate n terminals.
- Total steps = (n-1) + n = 2n - 1

## Q8. If height of tree generated for string is 'n' then find minimum & maximmum length of String if grammar is in CNF, tree of height n?
- n will be the minimum length of string, where From one children we genrate one terminal symbol, and from other children we generate two N.T. symbols.
- $2^{n-1}$ will be the maximum length of string, where both children we generate two non-terminals upto n-1 height and at last we generate terminal symbols for all.

## Advantages of CNF
- Fix no. of steps to generate any string
- Length of production is fix
- Due to such fix length, if CFG is in CNF it can be stored easily in computer
- CYK membership algorithm can be easily applied if grammar is in CNF or not. Time Complexity :- O($n^{3}$), This is universal Algo can work on both ambiguous and unambiguous grammar.
