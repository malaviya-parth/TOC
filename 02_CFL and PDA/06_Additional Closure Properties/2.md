## Right Quotient with Regular:-
The right quotient of L1 with L2 is the set of all strings x where you can pick some element y from L2 and append it to x to get something from L1. That is, x is in the quotient if there is y in L2 for which xy is in L1.

Let's agree to write the quotient of L1 by L2 as L1/L2.

Here are some examples:

- Say that L1 is the language {fish,dog,carrot} and that L2 is the language {rot}. Then L1/L2, the quotient of L1 by L2, is the language {car}, because car is the only string for which you can append something from L2 to get something from L1.
- Say that L1 is the language {carrot,parrot,rot} and that L2 is the language {rot}. Then L1/L2 is the language {car,par,œµ}. 
- Say that L3={rot,cheese}. Then L1/L3 is also {car,par,œµ}.
- Say that L1={carrot} and L2={t,ot}. Then L1/L2 is {carro,carr}.
- Say that L1={xab,yab} and L2={b,ab}. Then L1/L2 is {xa,ya,x,y}.
- Say that L1={œµ,a,ab,aba,abab,‚Ä¶} and L2={b,bb,bbb,‚Ä¶}. Then L1/L2 is {a,aba,ababa,‚Ä¶}.

> In general, if L2 contains œµ, then L1/L2 will contain L1.  
> In general, if L2=P‚à™Q, thenL1/L2=(L1/P)‚à™(L1/Q).  
> In general, if L1=P‚à™Q, then L1/L2=(P/L2)‚à™(Q/L2).

The two foregoing facts mean that you can calculate the right quotient of two languages L1 and L2 as follows: Let s1 be some element of L1 and let s2 be some element of L2. If s2 is a suffix of s1, so that s1=xs2 for some string x, then x is in the quotient L1/L2. Repeat this for every possible choice of s1 and s2 and you will have found every element of L1/L2.

- $L_1/L_2$ = \{ $w | \exists x \in L_2$ such that $wx \in L_1$\}

## Left Quotient with Regular:-
- $L_1\backslash L_2$ = \{ $w | \exists x \in L_2$ such that $xw \in L_1$\}

## Q. $L_1$ = {01,001,101,0001,1101} & $L_2$ = {0,1}
- $L_1/L_2$ = {0, 00, 10, 000, 110}
- $L_1\backslash L_2$ = {1, 01, 001, 101}

## Q. $L_1$ = {01,10,11} & $L_2$ = {1}
- $L_1/L_2$ = {0,1}
- $L_1\backslash L_2$ = {0,1}

> $L_1/L_2$ & $L_1\backslash L_2$ may or may not be same.

## Q. $L_1$ = 10\*1, $L_2$ = 0\*1
- $L_1$ = {1, 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, ...}
- $L_2$ = {1, 01, 001, 0001, 00001, ...}
- $L_1/L_2$ = {1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, ...} = 10*
- $L_1\backslash L_2$ = {1, 01, 001, 0001, 00001, ...} = 0*1

## Q. $L_1$ = a\*baa\*, $L_2$ = ab*
- $L_1$ = {ba, baa, aba, abaa, aaba, aabaa, ...}
- $L_2$ = {a, ab, abb, abbb, abbbb, ...}
- $L_1/L_2$ = {b, ba, ab, aba, aab, aaba, ...} = $a^{*}ba^{*}$
- $L_1\backslash L_2$ = {ba, baa, aba, abaa, a, aa, aaa, ...} = $a^{*}ba^{+} + a^{+}$
- $L_2/L_1$ = $\phi$
- $L_2\backslash L_1$ = $\phi$ (Checküí°)

### We can see here that $L_1/L_2 \subset L_1$ & $L_1\backslash L_2 \subset L_1$
- But in case of $L_1$ = $a^+$ and $L_2$ = $a$
  - $L_1 \subset L_1/L_2$ & $L_1 \subset L_1\backslash L_2$

### If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are $\infty$ then $L_1/L_2$ and $L_1\backslash L_2$ may be finite or $\infty$.

> Note:-
>> Regular Languages are not allowed in 5 operations i.e. $\infty \cap$, $\infty \cup$, $\infty$ set difference, Superset & subset.  
>> None is closed in these 5 operations.  
>> Except these 5 operations regular languages are closed in all other operations.
