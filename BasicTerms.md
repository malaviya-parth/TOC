# Basic Terms

### Symbol 
- It can be a character.
- It is a basic unit of a language.
- Example: a, b, c, 1, 2, 3, +, -, *, /, etc.

### Alphabet
- It is a <b>non-empty</b> <b>finite</b> set of <b>symbols</b>.
- It is denoted by Σ.
- Example: {a, b, c}, {0, 1}, {a, b, c, 0, 1}, etc.

### String
- It is a <b>finite</b> sequence of <b>symbols</b> from an <b>alphabet</b>.
- It is denoted by w.
- Given an alphabet Σ, the set of all strings over Σ is denoted by Σ*.
- Example: Σ = {a, b, c}, w = ab, w = abc, w = aab, etc. but w = aabbb..., w = acd, etc. are not strings. (Because one is infinite and another is not from the alphabet Σ.)
