1. NDTM
    - Same Power
   - There exist an algorithm for conversion of NDTM to DTM (Decidable Problem)
   - If a problem is solved by NDTM in polynomial time, then it will be solved by DTM in exponential time.
   - P Class: Problems that can be solved by DTM in polynomial time
   - NP Class: Problems that can be solved by NDTM in polynomial time

2. TM with 3 states
    - Same Power
    - Helpful like minimum how many states will be required then we can say that it is not possible to solve the problem with less than 3 states.
3. Multi Tape TM with stayoptions
   - Using this we can make any TM with atmost 2 states.
4. Multi Head TM
   - Same Power
   - Here heads are given priority.
