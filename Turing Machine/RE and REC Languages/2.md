# Properties of RE & REC

## 1. Turing Enumberable Procedure

An **algorithm that can be implemented by a Turing machine** is called a Turing-enumerable procedure.  

Not all **Enumerable Procedures** can be implemented by a Turing machine.  

If T.E.P. exists then Language is called **Turing-enumerable language (RE).**  

If T.E.P. does not exist then Language is called **Non R.E. language.**  

L is RE iff $\exists$ T.E.P. which can run on TM & TM can print all members of L one by one on it's tape.  

L is REC iff $\exists$ T.E.P. for members as well as non-members i.e. $\exists$ TM which can print both members & non-members of L one by one on it's tape.  

## L has no TEP
- Region 3

## If either L or $\bar{L}$ has no TEP
- L is RE or Non-RE (region 2 or 3)

## If L has EP then L is
- RE or REC or Non-RE(region 1 or 2 or 3)

## If L has TEP then L is
- L is RE or REC (region 1 or 2)

## If L has TEP but $\bar{L}$ has no TEP then
- L is RE (region 2)

## If L and $\bar{L}$ both have TEP then
- L is REC (region 1)

## 2. Membership Algorithm:-
- It is used to list all members and non-members of L.
- L is REC if L has membership algorithm.
- Decidable languages have membership algorithm, Non-Decidable languages do not have membership algorithm.

## L has Membership Algorithm
- REC (Region 1)

## L has no Membership Algorithm
- RE or Non-RE (Region 2 or 3)

## $\bar{L}$ has Membership Algorithm
- REC (Region 1)

## 3. Lexicographic Ordering:-
- L is REC iff L can be enumerated in Lexicographic ordering/ alphabetical ordering/ dictionary ordering.
